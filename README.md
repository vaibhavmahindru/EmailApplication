# Email Application

## Simple app to create new email account for new hires.

It performs the following actions:-

- Genrate an email with the following syntax: fisrtname.lastname@department.company.com
- Determine the department.
- Genrate random string for a password.
- Set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity and define an alternate email id.
- Get methods to display the name, email and mailbox capacity.

## I have added methods like change password, set alternate id and set mail box capacity but didn't used them in the code by calling those methods.
